            My fianc&eacute;, his little brother and I made an endless runner for a 48-hour game making challenge.
            We missed the one happening in Melbourne so we set out a weekend to try it ourselves and were able to develop
            our idea from concept to completed game. We used Unity engine with C#, all the artwork and sound effects were done by
            Ethan, and my fianc&eacute; and I programmed it. I was involved with the programming and worked on a lot of the
            key-frame animations.
